@par Example Description 

This example describes how to measure VBAT voltage using ADC1 regular channel 18.
In fact, the measured value correspond to VBAT/2; as the VBAT voltage could be higher
than VDDA, to ensure the correct operation of the ADC, the VBAT pin is internally
connected to a bridge divider by 2.

In this example the VBAT/2 voltage is continuously converted, each time an end
of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the converted data from 
ADC1 DR register to the ADCConvertedValue variable.  
However, in real application to prevent any unwanted consumption on the battery,
it is recommended to enable the bridge divider only when needed for ADC
conversion then disable it.

User can display the VBAT voltage on the Eval Board LCD (when the define PRINT_ON_LCD
is enabled in main.c)

In this example, the system clock is 120MHz, APB2 =60MHz and ADC clock = APB2 /2.
So ADCCLK= 30MHz 

Conversion rate of Vbat channel  = Sampling Time + Conversion Time = 15 + 12 cycles
                                 = 27 cycles ==> Conversion Time = 30MHz/27cyc = 1.11Msps.
