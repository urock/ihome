@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the HASH peripheral to 
hash data using SHA-1 and MD5 Algorithms.

For this example, no DMA is used for data transfer.

The SHA-1 message digest result is a 160 bit data and the MD5 message digest result 
is a 128 bit data.

The SHA-1 and MD5 digests can be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using the USART (CN16).

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" tool.


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs only on STM32F21x Devices (Cryptographic acceleration not 
    embedded in STM32F20x Devices).
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2
  
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
